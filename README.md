The output (patch) produced by the `bsdiff` Rust library will be different than the patch created by the `bsdiff` CLI tools. Nevertheless, the patches themselves should be fully `BSDIFF4` compatible.

The binaries modified by this utility will be exactly the same.

The name of the project doesn't mean anything - it was just suggested by github.

## Disclaimer

This code is *mostly* produced by means of "Vibe Coding", as I don't have much experience with Rust.
